Data attributes needed for an alarm clock would include:
1. Current time (Datetime)
2. Alarm time (Datetime)
3. Alarm active status (Boolean)
4. Alarm ringtone (String)
5. Snooze (Timedelta)

Restrictions for these would be:
1. Current time must be the current time
2. Alarm time must be a future time / a time greater than current time
3. Alarm active status must be true or false
4. Alarm sound must be a valid file
5. Snooze must be a positive value

The methods used would be:
1. Set Alarm (public) - sets the alarm time.
2. Snooze Alarm (public) - adds the snooze duration to the alarm time.
3. Turn Off Alarm (public) - sets the alarm active to False.
4. Play Alarm Sound (private) - plays the alarm sound.
5. Check Alarm (private) - checks if the current time is equal to the alarm time and if alarm active is True.

Pseudocode:
Class AlarmClock:
    initialize current_time, datatype datetime
    initialize alarm_time, datatype datetime
    initialize alarm_active, datatype Boolean
    initialize alarm_sound, datatype string
    initialize snooze_duration, datatype timedelta
    
    Function set_alarm(time: datetime)
        alarm_time = time
    
    Function snooze_alarm()
        alarm_time = alarm_time + snooze_duration
    
    Function turn_off_alarm()
        alarm_active = False
    
    Function _play_alarm_sound()
        play alarm_sound
    
    Function _check_alarm()
        if current_time == alarm_time and alarm_active == True:
            _play_alarm_sound()



Current time: 18:55:27
Enter the alarm time (HH:MM:SS): 18:55:50

Time's up
