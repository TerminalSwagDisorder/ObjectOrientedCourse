how could i utilize classes/objects in the provided code?


To utilize classes/objects in the provided code, you can create a class for each component type (CPU, GPU, Cooler, etc.) and a class to handle the scraping and updating process. Here's an example of how you could refactor the code using classes:

Create classes for each component type:
python
Copy code
class CPU:
    def __init__(self, name, manufacturer, core_count, performance_core_clock, performance_boost_clock, tdp, integrated_graphics, l3_cache, simultaneous_multithreading, includes_cpu_cooler, socket, price, url):
        self.name = name
        self.manufacturer = manufacturer
        self.core_count = core_count
        self.performance_core_clock = performance_core_clock
        self.performance_boost_clock = performance_boost_clock
        self.tdp = tdp
        self.integrated_graphics = integrated_graphics
        self.l3_cache = l3_cache
        self.simultaneous_multithreading = simultaneous_multithreading
        self.includes_cpu_cooler = includes_cpu_cooler
        self.socket = socket
        self.price = price
        self.url = url

# Similarly, create classes for GPU, Cooler, Motherboard, Memory, Storage, PSU, and Case
Create a class to handle the scraping and updating process:
python
Copy code
class PCPartPickerScraper:
    def __init__(self, search_terms, pcpartpicker_scraper):
        self.search_terms = search_terms
        self.pcpartpicker_scraper = pcpartpicker_scraper

    def scrape_and_update(self, session):
        for partcategory in self.search_terms:
            # (Continue with the existing scraping code)
            # (Instead of creating dictionaries for upsert, create objects of the respective classes)
            cpu = CPU(partname, specsdict["Manufacturer"], specsdict["Core Count"], specsdict["Performance Core Clock"], specsdict["Performance Boost Clock"], specsdict["TDP"], specsdict["Integrated Graphics"], specsdict["L3 Cache"], specsdict["Simultaneous Multithreading"], specsdict["Includes CPU Cooler"], specsdict["Socket"], partprice["Price"], parturl["Url"])
            # (Similarly, create objects for GPU, Cooler, Motherboard, Memory, Storage, PSU, and Case)

            # (Update the upsert and insert code to work with the newly created objects)
            # ...

    # (You can also create helper methods for upsert and insert operations)

Update the main part of the script to use the newly created classes:
python
Copy code
search_terms = [...] # As before
pcpartpicker = pcpartpicker.Scraper() # As before

scraper = PCPartPickerScraper(search_terms, pcpartpicker)
scraper.scrape_and_update(session)
By refactoring the code to use classes and objects, you can make it more modular, organized, and easier to maintain.
